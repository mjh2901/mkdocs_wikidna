# MKDocs WikiDNA
MkDocs port of the WikiDNA network documentation templates.

This repository is a MkDocs-formatted port of the original WikiDNA content. The docs have been converted and reorganized to work with MkDocs + the Material theme.

This README is a lightweight entry point â€” the full content lives under `docs/` and the site is generated with MkDocs.

- About: `docs/about.md`
