# Migration & Cleanup Report

Date: 2025-09-26

This report summarizes the automated migration, cleanup, verification steps, and repository housekeeping I performed on this MkDocs documentation project.

Summary of actions
- Initialized a local git repository and committed the working changes (rename start.md -> index.md, link updates, helper scripts, and many cleaned Markdown files).
- Added a conservative `.gitignore` and removed generated artifacts from the commit index: `site/` and `scripts/.venv/`.
- Rebuilt the site with MkDocs in Docker (--strict --verbose). Build succeeded.
- Ran the stricter Markdown checker script: OK.
- Ran the internal site link/anchor checker against `site/`: No broken internal links or anchors found.
- Performed a limited external link probe (HEAD/GET) of up to 20 external URLs found in the generated site; results below.
- Scanned `docs/` for suspicious DokuWiki-like patterns and identified files that likely need manual review.

Commit information
- Branch: `prepare/docs-cleanup` (local, renamed from main during amend)
- Latest commit: Rename start.md -> index.md, update links; add markdown/link helper scripts
- Commit hash (HEAD): see local repo for exact hash (created in this environment).

Verification outputs

1) MkDocs build
- Command: `docker-compose run --rm mkdocs build --strict --verbose`
- Result: Documentation built in ~2.19 seconds. No strict-mode errors reported.

2) Markdown strict checker
- Command: `python3 scripts/check_md_strict.py`
- Result: OK

3) Internal link checker
- Command: `python3 scripts/link_check.py`
- Result: Scanned 76 HTML files, checked 6019 links. No broken internal links or anchors found.

4) External links (limited probe)
- Found 4 unique external links in `site/`. Tested up to 20 (only 4 present).
- Results: 3 OK, 1 BAD
  - BAD: `https:*github.com/mjh2901/WikiDNA` — malformed URL (no host given). This is likely a generated or legacy malformed link that should be fixed (missing / after https:). Search for references to `mjh2901/WikiDNA` in docs and fix the href to `https://github.com/mjh2901/WikiDNA` if intended.

Files flagged for manual review (24 files)
- These files contain pipe-table fragments, caret characters, or other patterns likely originating from DokuWiki tables or templates. The conversion script handled many cases, but tables with many empty cells remain and need human review to fill or remove columns.

List:
```

Suggested next steps
- Fix external malformed URL(s) — search for `mjh2901/WikiDNA` and correct it.
- Manually inspect the 24 flagged files and decide per-file whether to:
  - convert empty table columns into proper Markdown tables and populate cells, or
  - replace tables with simple lists or placeholders, or
  - remove undead placeholders left over from the DokuWiki export.
- If you want the commit pushed upstream, tell me the remote URL and target branch; I can create a PR with these changes. Alternatively, you can review and push from your environment.
- If you prefer `site/` and `scripts/.venv/` removed from history entirely, I can run a history-rewrite but that's destructive — I recommend keeping the amend I performed (it removes them from the current commit) and pushing normally.

How I validated
- Rebuilt site in Docker, re-ran checkers, and ran a limited external probe. Internal links are validated against generated HTML anchors.

Commands I ran (representative)
```bash
cd /Users/Shared/docker/mkdocs_netdna
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "Rename start.md -> index.md, update links; add markdown/link helper scripts"
docker-compose run --rm mkdocs build --strict --verbose
python3 scripts/check_md_strict.py
python3 scripts/link_check.py
``` 

If you want any of the suggested next steps done now, tell me which and I'll proceed.
