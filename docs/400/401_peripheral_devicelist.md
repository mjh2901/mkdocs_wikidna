NOTE: This document allows a place to keep track of the minimal unique elements of potentially a large number of hardware devices.

ID of Device simply increment to create unique ID's per location that will increase chronologically. The first three characters show this to be a WORstation item. The next three show this as the IDEntification for the Device. This is needed to create a uniqueness for every piece of hardwareâ€¦ It will be possible for the same model to be used multiple times with the same deviations used multiple times.

Ref Model is an incremented ID per different hardware model type. This allows documentation of similar pieces of hardware to require less work. The first three characters show this to be a WORstation item, the next three catagorize it as the MODel information.

Deviation from Mfr Model defaults allows for a document to list the things that have been changed to a particlar piece of hardware while maintaining the benefit of using the documentation that completes a majority of information needed about the piece of equipment. This gets its name from being a WORstation type item with a DEViation. The 4 digits represent the model this deviation is an extention of and the itieration this deviation is in a potential list of many different changes to different pieces of hardware. The first two digits are the referenced model and the last two are the unique deviation number for that model number.

This method of naming devices allows the label on the device to show what location this device should be at, if this device deviates from the manufacturer defaults or not, What model document to reference and what device this is in the device list.
